Unit testing and mocking a serial port

I've found "Send and Read SMS through a GSM Modem using AT Commands" (https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/38705/Send-and-Read-SMS-through-a-GSM-Modem-using-AT-Com).

I thoutht that it might be a good starting point for learning how to write unit tests for existing code and how to mock a serial port.

The end goal is to refactor the code so that it follows the SOLID design principles and remove dead/unreachable code.
